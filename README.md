# ModelBased_RecommendationSystem

Model-based recommendation systems involve building a model based on the dataset of ratings. In other words, we extract some information from the dataset, and use that as a "model" to make recommendations without having to use the complete dataset every time. This approach potentially offers the benefits of both speed and scalability.
